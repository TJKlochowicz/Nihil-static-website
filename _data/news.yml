    ### LIRa session: Jialiang Yan

    **Title**: Knowing and believing an epistemic possibility\

    **Abstract**: What does it mean to know or believe that something might be the case? In this talk, we address the issue focusing on the epistemic possibility expressed by English might when embedded under the propositional attitude verbs know and believe. 
    We present some puzzles to highlight the challenges arising from such know-might and believe-might sentences...

    ### Maria Aloni will deliver the Annual Logic Lecture at the University Of Connecticut

    **Title**: Nothing is Logical\

    **Abstract**: People often reason contrary to the prescriptions of classical logic. In the talk I will discuss some cases of divergence between everyday and logical-mathematical reasoning and propose that they are a consequence of a tendency in human cognition to neglect models which verify sentences by virtue of an empty configuration [neglect-zero tendency, Aloni 2022]. I will then introduce a bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML) which formally represents the neglect-zero tendency and can be used to rigorously study its impact on reasoning and interpretation. After discussing some of the applications, I will compare BSML with related systems (truthmaker semantics, possibility semantics, and inquisitive semantics) via translations into Modal Information Logic [van Benthem 2019].

    ### SuB28 Poster Marco Degano

    Marco Degano will present joint work with Paul Marty, Sonia Ramotowska, Maria Aloni, Richard Breheny, Jacopo Romoli, and Yasu Sudo at Sinn und Bedeutung 28. \

    **Title**: Distinguishing between speaker’s uncertainty and possibility

     **Abstract**: The work reports on two experiments that tested whether sentences containing disjunctions like "the mystery box contains a blue ball or a yellow ball" can give rise to possibility inferences without uncertainty. The results showed that participants derived possibility inferences even when uncertainty was not present, challenging traditional accounts of ignorance inferences and supporting recent proposals that derive possibility independently of uncertainty.

    ### PALLMYR talk by Tomasz Klochowicz

    Tomasz Klochowicz presented his work on Free Choice Question at XIII Paris-Amsterdam-London Logic Meeting for Young Reaserchers \

    **Title**: Free Choice Questions

     **Abstract**: Polar questions like 'May I go to the park or to the beach?' give rise to inferences similar to Free Choice Permission. The *Yes* answer to these questions corresponds to the permission to freely choose between going to the park and going to the beach. *No* corresponds to Dual Prohibition, i.e., prohibition to go to either place. I empirically tested these intuitions. I will indicate how the collected data can allow us to establish the source of these inferences and compare the findings to predictions made by current theories of Free Choice extended with question semantics. The collected data poses a challenge to the semantic and scalar approaches to *free choice* and supports non-scalar pragmatics as a uniform solution to the *free choice* puzzle.

    ### Prototype for a reasoning algorithm for BSML.

    Ronald de Haan has put together a prototype for a reasoning algorithm for bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML) based on answer set programming. 
    Here you can find a brief demonstration and some explanations, as well as a list with some possible research directions:
    [https://github.com/rdehaan/bsml-sat/blob/main/demo.ipynb](https://github.com/rdehaan/bsml-sat/blob/main/demo.ipynb) 
    There are a lot of small and large directions for improving this reasoner, and many of them are very much suitable for a small research project or a thesis.
    Please feel free to get in touch with Ronald (me@ronalddehaan.eu) if you are interested in this.
