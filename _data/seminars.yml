  title: An Axiomatization of Bilateral State-based Modal Logic
  location: ILLC seminar room F1.15 in Science Park 107
  abstract: >
    **Abstract:** Bilateral State-based Modal Logic (BSML) is a modal logic employing team/state-based semantics which can be used to model free choice inference and other natural language phenomena. We introduce a natural deduction system for BSML as well as for two extensions: BSML with the inquisitive disjunction and BSML with a novel emptiness operator. We also study the expressive power of these logicsâ€”we show that the two extensions are expressively complete.
