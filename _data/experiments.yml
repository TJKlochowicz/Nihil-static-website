#===========
# ATENTION! This file is very indentation sensitive. 
# It is much easier to edit in a local editor (e.g. vs code)
# If you are editing on github please be careful while copy-pasting the template.
# If you want to ad a colon (:) to your text put the whole input value in quotation marks "string" to avoid errors. 
#
# If you want to add a pdf with slides put the file in assets\slides and add a relative path to the url field.
#
# Experiments are sorted by date, but the date is not displayed.
